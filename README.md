## Research Overview

This study addresses building cooling load prediction under data-scarce conditions by developing a novel transfer learning framework. The key contributions include:

1. **Source building selection optimization**: A multi-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measurement method
2. **Multi-feature integration**: Weighted similarity analysis incorporating both cooling load and meteorological parameters
3. **Comprehensive model development**: Five prediction models including baseline and transfer learning variants
4. **Empirical validation**: Real office building data from five different climate zones

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning: outlier removal, missing value imputation, weekend data filtering
- Feature engineering: 
  - Temporal features (sinusoidal encoding of hour and day)
  - Lag features (1, 2, 3, 24, 48-hour lags)
  - Statistical features (3-hour and 24-hour moving averages)
  - Cross-features (temperature-to-humidity ratio)
  - Meteorological parameters and occupancy schedule

### Multi-dimensional DTW Similarity
- Weighted Euclidean distance based on feature importance
- Features considered: cooling load, air temperature, dew point temperature
- Source building selection: Top 3 most similar buildings

### Prediction Models
Five models were implemented and compared:

| Model Type | Model Name | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Baseline | LightGBM | Gradient boosting baseline |
| Baseline | LSTM | Long Short-Term Memory baseline |
| Transfer Learning | LightGBM-WI | LightGBM with weight initialization |
| Transfer Learning | LSTM-FT | LSTM with fine-tuning |
| Transfer Learning | LSTM-FE | LSTM with feature extraction |

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Key Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, lightgbm, torch/tensorflow, fastdtw, matplotlib

## Key Results

Based on our experimental evaluation:

1. Transfer learning effectiveness:
   - LightGBM-WI: 15.75% average reduction in CVRMSE compared to baseline
   - LSTM-FT: 13.19% average reduction in CVRMSE compared to baseline

2. Source selection importance:
   - DTW-based screening further reduced prediction error by 1.62% (LightGBM-WI) and 13.65% (LSTM-FT) compared to using all source buildings

3. Model comparison insights:
   - LSTM generally outperformed LightGBM in baseline comparisons
   - Fine-tuning was more effective than feature extraction for LSTM models
   - LightGBM-WI offered better stability while LSTM-FT achieved higher accuracy peaks
